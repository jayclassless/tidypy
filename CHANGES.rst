* Added a ``ignore-roles`` option to the ``rstlint`` tool to help deal with
  non-standard ReST text roles.

**Changes**

* Changed the ``merge_issues`` and ``ignore_missing_extends`` options to
  ``merge-issues`` and ``ignore-missing-extends`` for naming consistency.
* Replaced the ``radon`` tool with the traditional ``mccabe`` tool.

**Fixes**

* Fixed issue that caused TidyPy to spin out of control if you used CTRL-C to
  kill it while it was executing tools.
* Fixed issue where ``pylint``'s ``duplicate-code`` issue was reported only
  against one file, and it was usually the wrong file. TidyPy will now report
  an issue against each file identified with the duplicate code.
* Numerous fixes to support running TidyPy on Windows.


0.2.0 (2017-11-04)
==================

  and report it as a ``tidypy:tool`` issue.
